# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of my ability to become more comfortable with the coursework and vocabulary today, as well as the software we use. Over the course of completing the assignments I had to go back and review all of the prior material and it helped me to better understand things.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
Functions are important because you can combine so many different types of things we've learned all into one process where you manipulate all the variable in order to change the output. It allows you to break a much bigger process down into several smaller tasks so that the overrall goal can be more easily accomplised.
